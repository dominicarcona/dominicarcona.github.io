  <!-- TEACHING PHILOSOPHY -->
  <section>
    <p>
      I believe that everyone can have meaningful and empowering mathematical learning
      experiences. Over the past ten-plus years, I have worked extensively as an individual tutor,
      supporting students with diverse backgrounds, goals, and learning styles. A more detailed discussion of my teaching philosophy and approach can be found in my
      <a href="files/teaching-statement.pdf" target="_blank">teaching statement</a>.

  <!-- PRIVATE TUTORING -->
  <section>
    <h2>Private Tutoring</h2>

    <p>
      I have over a decade of experience providing one-on-one tutoring to students
      across a wide range of ages, abilities, and academic goals. I support learners
      in mathematics and the sciences at the middle school, high school, and college
      levels. If you are interested in my private tutoring services, please feel free
      to contact me at <a href="mailto:arcona@usc.edu">arcona@usc.edu</a>.

    <h3>Selected Student Profiles</h3>
    <p>
      I've had the privilege of working with a number of delightful students over the years.
      Here are some examples of students I've supported as a tutor.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary>Pre-med student underachieving in physics</summary>
      <p>
        Prompted by a 'C' on her first midterm exam, a pre-med undergraduate enrolled
        in calculus-based physics began working with me twice per week. Through
        targeted problem-solving strategies and conceptual explanations, she steadily
        gained confidence applying physics principles independently, aced her remaining
        exams, and earned a well-deserved 'A' in the course.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>High school Algebra I student with a busy schedule</summary>
      <p>
        A motivated high school student balancing athletics and extracurricular
        commitments while taking Algebra I came to me for support. Our once-weekly
        sessions focused on efficient study strategies, foundational skill-building,
        and exam preparation. The student quickly improved his grades and reported
        reduced math-related anxiety.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Middle school student getting ahead in math</summary>
      <p>
        The parents of a mathematically gifted middle school student approached me seeking
        to enrich their son's math experience beyond the standard curriculum. Together, we
        explored advanced problem-solving techniques and previewed concepts from future courses
        in algebra and geometry. The student developed strong mathematical intuition and
        enthusiasm for the subject, setting him up for accelerated learning in high school.

  <!-- TEACHING PHILOSOPHY -->
  <section>
    <p>
      I believe that everyone can have meaningful and empowering mathematical learning
      experiences. My teaching philosophy centers on clarity, intuition, and helping
      students build confidence in their ability to reason through complex ideas.
      Over the past ten-plus years, I have worked extensively as an individual tutor,
      supporting students with diverse backgrounds, goals, and learning styles.
      As a teaching assistant, I aim to create an inclusive and supportive classroom
      environment that emphasizes conceptual understanding alongside technical skill.
      I am particularly interested in helping students connect formal theory with
      practical application. A more detailed discussion of my approach can be found in my
      <a href="files/teaching-statement.pdf" target="_blank">teaching statement</a>.

    <h3>Selected Student Profiles</h3>

    <details>
      <summary>Undergraduate pre-med student struggling with physics</summary>
      <p>
        Worked with a pre-med undergraduate enrolled in calculus-based physics who
        was struggling to connect mathematical formalism with physical intuition.
        Through targeted problem-solving strategies and conceptual explanations,
        the student improved exam performance and gained confidence applying physics
        principles independently.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>High school Algebra I student with a busy schedule</summary>
      <p>
        Supported a high school student balancing athletics and extracurricular
        commitments while taking Algebra I. Sessions focused on efficient study
        strategies, foundational skill-building, and exam preparation, resulting
        in improved grades and reduced math-related anxiety.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Middle school student getting ahead in math</summary>
      <p>
        Tutored a motivated middle school student seeking enrichment beyond the
        standard curriculum. We explored advanced problem-solving techniques and
        previewed algebraic concepts, helping the student develop strong mathematical
        intuition and enthusiasm for the subject.

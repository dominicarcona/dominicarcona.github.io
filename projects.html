        <h3>Business Licensing Lead Prioritization</h3>

        <p class="project-context">
          A US state tax agency sought to improve tax compliance among businesses selling physical
          products online to state residents.
        </p>

        <ul class="project-points">
          <li> Identified and acquired high-value external data sources, supplemented by custom web-scraped data, to construct a comprehensive training dataset of remote sellers. </li> 
          <li> Built and deployed regression models in Python to prioritize licensing leads by predicted gross revenue, balancing interpretability with predictive performance. </li> 
          <li> Communicated modeling decisions and results to non-technical stakeholders to maintain buy-in throughout the project lifecycle. </li> 
          <li> Pilot outreach generated over $1M per month in voluntary tax remittance within two years of launch. </li> 
          <li> The project’s success led to adoption by multiple additional state clients and a company-wide “Outcome Award.” </li>

        <h3>Launching SME Lending Product</h3>

        <p class="project-context">
          A top-five international bank planned to launch a small-business lending product for a
          targeted customer segment.
        </p>

        <ul class="project-points">
          <li> Supported end-to-end product design, including pricing, risk, fraud strategy, and first-year KPI roadmapping. </li> 
          <li>Led the statistical design of the pricing experiment, including statistical power calculations, 
          test structure, and interpretation strategy for early post-launch decision making.</li>
          <li> Designed an A/B price-testing framework to be deployed immediately at product launch, ensuring sufficient statistical power for early decision-making. </li> 
          <li> A three-tier pricing structure was selected, enabling rapid learning about optimal pricing while managing downside risk. </li>

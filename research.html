    <!-- RESEARCH OVERVIEW -->
    <section>
      <p>
        My research lies at the intersection of probability, combinatorics, and stochastic processes.
        I am particularly interested in mixing times of Markov chains and card shuffling models. 
        My work focuses on probabilistic applications of algebraic tools from representation theory 
        and symmetric function theory to better understand convergence phenomena.

            We use representation theory of Sn to analyze the mixing of permutation cycle type statistics 
            \( a_j(σ)={# of j-cycles of σ}\) for any fixed j and σ resulting from a random i-cycle walk on Sn. 
            We also derive analogous results for the random star transposition walk. Our approach uses 
            the method of moments; a key ingredient is a new formula for the coefficients in the 
            irreducible character decomposition of the Sn-class function \((a_j)r(σ)={(# of j-cycles of σ)r}\)
            for any positive integers \(r,j\) when \(n≥2rj\).

            It is well known that the character of the defining representation of \(S_n\) over \(\mathbb{C}\), 
            \(\chi^\varrho(\sigma)\) encodes the number of fixed points of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_n\). 
            It is hard in general to take tensor products of representations of \(S_n\), but it is known how 
            to decompose tensor powers of the defining representation as a direct sum of irreducible 
            representations. Alon and Kozma gave a decomposition of the \(S_n\)-class function 
            \(a_j(\sigma)\) = {#\(j\)-cycles of \(\sigma\)} in terms of irreducible characters. This class 
            function is the character of a virtual representation of \(S_n\). We describe how to decompose 
            tensor powers of this virtual representation as a linear combination of irreducible 
            representations when \(n\) is large enough. As an application, we state a new result concerning 
            \(j\)-cycle mixing via the random \(i\)-cycle walk on \(S_n\).
